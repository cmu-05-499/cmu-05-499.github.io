Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group's work.

Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honesty and collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of \"group.\"</p> <p>If any of your work contains a statement that was was copied verbatim from an external source, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. If you are using a tool to help format or structure text significantly based on content and facts that you provided, you must acknowledge the use of such tools (see policy on generative AI tools above). Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.</p> <p>Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on Academic Integrity).</p> <p>If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors for clarification.</p> <p>Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations.</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/#diversity-statement","title":"Diversity Statement","text":"<p>Your classmates are your colleagues.

Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.</p> <p>Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:</p> <ul> <li>Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150</li> <li>Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting cmu.ethicspoint.com.</li> </ul> <p>All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.

Oftentimes, visual content in an image is not mentioned in the audio track. In that case, you\u2019ll need to provide information about the visuals in the audio track so that people who can\u2019t see the visuals have access to them. This can be tricky, mostly because of timing -- it can be really hard to fit in audio descriptions into natural pauses.</p> <p>You can add video descriptions in a few different ways. One is to use video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere or iMovie, to add a new audio track to the video that contains the descriptions. Another way is to upload your video to YouTube, and then use the YouDescribe service to add the alternative descriptions. For some reason, it\u2019s a little tricky to find the video you want to describe from the YouDescribe interface -- the best approach I\u2019ve found is to post your video publicly on YouTube, then search for your username, which should display all of your public videos.</p> <p>Regardless of tool used, you\u2019ll want to think about what you\u2019ll need to describe, versus what doesn\u2019t need visual description. For instance, if a person is talking, there\u2019s probably no reason to say that there is a person on-screen. But, you might want to describe facial expressions, or mention someone sneaking onto the screen.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a video describing how to create audio descriptions using iMovie, including a number of useful tidbits about what goes into a good audio description. Here\u2019s a short professionally-created video that has been audio described.

This is the natural result in simple pages, but as content can be placed pretty much wherever you want. And, as web pages are increasingly formed by bringing in content for various sources, sometimes the result is a nonsensical order.</p> <p>Another element of this is that to be able to effectively \u201ctab through\u201d a web page, you need to be able to see what element currently has focus. Setting the outline property to \u201cnone\u201d in CSS, or making the change on focus too difficult to see, can make doing so very hard.

Miscommunication or the general lack of communication are the most common causes of team conflict. </p> <p>Team Conflict Example</p> <p>A common conflict in working style is when there are team members who always want to get a headstart on their work, while there are team members who are fine with doing work a few days before the deadline. It causes panic in the former team members, while the latter team members feel frustrated as to why they are being rushed. </p> <p>As such, your first process task of the semester will be creating a teamwork contract with your teammates. It is a 1 - 2 page document containing information that all teammates agree to follow. You should work on the contract with all members present. We recommend that you keep it to around 1 page, 2 pages is a hard limit.</p> <p>Additionally, it is more important that you only include statements that the team will adhere to than it is to fulfill the length requirement (quality over quantity!) You do not need to write full sentences (bullet points are okay), but your decisions must be clearly conveyed in the document.</p> <p>You are free to include anything that your team deems necessary, but you should minimally address the following sections:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Expectations How much time is each team member expected to be putting into working on projects? Punctuality? How would your team accommodate when unexpected commitments come up for a team member (e.g. interviews, sickness, competitions)? Do account for the fact that project load can get heavier towards the end of the semester. </p> </li> <li> <p>Communication What platform (s) will your team be using to communicate? What is the expected time to get a response?  For any communication platforms you decide on, please test that everyone can receive notifications. We highly recommend using apps (Slack, Discord) over browser-based sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Meeting Schedule When and how will your team meet? What modality would it be?  A strong recommendation would be to set up a recurring 1hr meeting blocked out for the rest of the semester, so that your team does not have to scramble to find a common meeting time each week. Teams that have recurring meetings are generally more successful in the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responsibilities How will you divide responsibilities for each project? During meetings, who will be in charge of note taking, organizing &amp; running those meetings?  Often, a natural project manager will emerge, who will ensure the project moves towards completion. Throughout the semester, we will ask for documentation of your meeting notes, so be sure to keep them organized (we recommend using a shared Drive folder).</p> </li> <li> <p>Equitable Contribution &amp; Conflict Resolution What are the steps the team would take to address teammates who are contributing too little, and when will the team bring this up to the instructors? What are the steps to bring up and discuss potential teamwork issues? The first thing the staff will ask the student when they mention that they are facing team issues is if they have followed the steps on their team contract. How will you continue to work in the case of an irresolvable conflict between team members? The partner organization does not care if you like one another. They want to see results. Write down a set of practices you will follow to enable team members in a fight to continue to contribute without interfering with the functioning of the rest of the team.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Feel free to seek the assistance of TAs and instructors in drafting this document. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>We will ask you to reference, reflect upon, and refine this document throughout this semester, and we will evaluate your team's process strategies and interactions through what you outline in this contract. Please ensure that everyone on your team thoroughly discusses each of the above sections and agree with the final decisions.</p> <p>Once you have completed the contract itself, have all members sign and date the document as an indicator that all members have read the document and agreed to uphold all outlined items. Then, save the file as a PDF and upload it to Gradescope.
