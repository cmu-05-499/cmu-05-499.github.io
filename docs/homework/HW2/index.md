# Homework 2: Disability Deep-Dive

## Learning Goals

- Gain deep background in a disability of your choice

## Project Context

Many people are drawn to accessibility work due to personal connections to people in their lives who have a particular disability. This homework gives you the opportunity to learn as much as you can 
about a chosen disability and explain that to us in your writeup. We provide a structure for you to use in your writeup which will help guide you towards the important concepts in your understanding of disability.

This is an **individual assignment** worth 100 points.
