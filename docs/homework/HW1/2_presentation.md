# Homework 1B: Create an Accessible Presentation

## Deliverables

**Accessible Google Slides** - 50 points - due Tuesday, September 3, 11:59pm ET

## Background

Many presentation tools, like Powerpoint and Google Slides, have Accessibility Checker functions. While these tools are helpful, they can not catch all the problems that pop up in presentations. For this, we offer a checklist that you can use to consider various aspects of slide and presentation design that can improve its accessibility to a variety of audiences. 

ASSETS is the premier conference in ACM SIGCHI for presenting work related to accessibility for people with disabilities. The conference organizers have developed this handy [presentation guide](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) for conference talk authors to ensure that their entire audience can understand your talk. We include some of their guidelines below in the homework assignment. Hopefully (fingers crossed!) they don't conflict too much. 

Some other guides include:

1. University of Washington Professor Richard Ladner's paper, ["Making Your Conference Talk Accessible."](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ladner/MakingYourTalkAccessible.pdf)
1. Kyle Rector's [video on accessible presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9TxhGv91kc).

!!! warning
    These presentations have been sourced on the Internet. Some are short, some are long. Some contain technical content; some appear to be jokes. Whichever one you pick, as you edit them for accessibility, be careful to preserve your understanding of the authors' original intent. Whenever possible, do not change their message.
