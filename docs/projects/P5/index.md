# Project 5: Milestone 2

## Learning Goals

- Work together as a team, dividing up responsibility for user stories amongst the team members.
- Meet with your partner organization to communicate progress through demos of your work and asking questions to ensure what you build is what they want.
- Redesign your partner organization's products to improve their accessibility.
- Evaluate the application you are developing to ensure it works as expected.

## Project Context

Your team has begun implementing user stories towards an accessibility evaluation or an application solution. 

We expect you to meet at least once with your partner organization to share plans and results of this milestone. One of your deliverables for this milestone are the notes from this meeting.

Another deliverable for this milestone is the set of notes you take during your weekly team meetings. 

### Accessibility Evaluation Projects

If you are conducting an accessibility evaluation, your goal for this milestone is to design and implement the changes to your organization's existing application or web site to improve its accessibility. We require you to record a demonstration of any user stories implemented for the redesign (this can be done by anyone on your team), upload it to YouTube (keep it private) and turn in the URL to the video.

You must evaluate the accessibility of your work with at least one other person in this class who is not on your team. You must turn in all of the transcripts, notes, and analysis you create after evaluating the redesign of the application or web site with your participant. 


### Application Solution Projects

In this milestone, you will continue working on the user stories to implement your application. As before, you may change these user stories at any time, but we expect to see any and all changes documented in your project management system. In addition, all code must be checked into your GitHub repository. There must be work items that document your progress as well as designs on tools like Canva or Figma that reflect what your team is building.

By the end of this milestone, you will evaluate it with at least one person with the target disability. You may ask your partner organization for assistance in recruiting this person.

As per the IRB protocol you submitted with the last assignment, you must prepare recruitment flyers, consent forms, questionnaires, and evaluations. If you have not turned these in yet, you **must** run them by your TA for approval **prior** to engaging with any study participants. 

Your deliverables for this milestone are the transcripts, notes, and analyses of the evaluation. In addition, we require you to record a demonstration of any user stories implemented since the last milestone (this can be done by anyone on your team), upload it to YouTube (keep it private) and turn in the URL to the video.

 
## Deliverables

1. Notes from the meeting with your partner organization.
1. Notes from your team meetings.
1. For accessibility evaluation projects, all of the transcripts, notes, and analysis you create after evaluating the redesign of your application or web site.
1. For application solution projects, any materials for the IRB protocol that were not created or turned in for the previous assignment and all of the transcripts, notes, and analysis you create after evaluating the application.
1. For all project types, a URL of the video demonstrating implemented user stories. 


## Deadlines

There is one **group deliverable** for this project. This part is worth 168 points, or 20% of your project grade. This part is due November 26, 2024 11:59pm. 

To receive full credit for project milestone 2, we expect that all deliverables listed above are included in a PDF document submitted to Gradescope.
