# Project 4: Milestone 1

## Learning Goals

- Work together as a team, dividing up responsibility for user stories amongst the team members.
- Meet with your partner organization to communicate progress through demos of your work and asking questions to ensure what you build is what they want.
- Evaluate the accessibility of your partner organization's products.
- Pilot test the application you are developing to ensure it comes along as expected.

## Project Context

Now that your team has created a specification for its goals, this milestone will propel you forward towards your intermediate goals.

We expect you to meet at least once with your partner organization to share plans and results of this milestone. One of your deliverables for this milestone are the notes from this meeting.

Another deliverable for this milestone is the set of notes you take during your weekly team meetings. 

### Accessibility Evaluation Projects

If you are conducting an accessibility evaluation, your goal for this milestone is to evaluate the existing application or web site with at least 5 people who have the target disability. You may ask your partner organization for assistance in recruiting these 5 people. 

As per the IRB protocol you submitted with the last assignment, you must prepare recruitment flyers, consent forms, questionnaires, and evaluations. If you have not turned these in yet, you **must** run them by your TA for approval **prior** to engaging with any of your study participants. 

Your deliverable for this portion of the project is all of the transcripts, notes, and analysis you create after evaluating the application or web site with your participants. 

We note that these requirements are deliberately vague, to give your team the latitude it requires to customize the accessibility evaluation for the needs of the application or web site and your partner organization. You must demonstrate that your evaluation builds on everything you have learned so far in this class (and should it require, go beyond as well). 

### Application Solution Projects

In this milestone, you will begin building your application according to the user stories you have submitted in the previous assignment. You may change these user stories at any time, but we expect to see any and all changes documented in your project management system. In addition, all code must be checked into your GitHub repository. There must be work items that document your progress as well as designs on tools like Canva or Figma that reflect what your team intends to build.

By the end of this milestone, you will pilot test the application (as much as you have built) with one other person in the class who is not on your team. You should document the pilot test through recordings, transcripts, and analysis of how it went and lessons learned. You must document changes to any user stories that were inspired by the results of the pilot. 

Your deliverables for this milestone are the transcripts and analysis of the pilot study. In addition, we require you to record a demonstration of the implemented user stories (this can be done by anyone on your team), upload it to YouTube (keep it private) and turn in the URL to the video.

 
## Deliverables

1. Notes from the meeting with your partner organization.
1. Notes from your team meetings.
1. For accessibility evaluation projects, any materials for the IRB protocol that were not created or turned in for the previous assignment and all of the transcripts, notes, and analysis you create after evaluating the application or web site.
1. For application solution projects, the transcripts and analysis of the pilot study as well as a URL of the video demonstrating implemented user stories. 


## Deadlines

There is one **group deliverable** for this project. This part is worth 168 points, or 20% of your project grade. This part is due November 14, 2024 11:59pm. 

To receive full credit for project milestone 1, we expect that all deliverables listed above are included in a PDF document submitted to Gradescope.
