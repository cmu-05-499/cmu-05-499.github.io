## Accessibility Evaluation Projects

Your report should include the following elements (most of which are cleaned up versions of information you provided in P3, P4, and P5):

1. **Title of your Project**

1. **Name of your Partner Organization and Main Person You Collaborated With**

1. **Project Context and Goals** (0.5 pages)
An analysis of the project's context and the goals your team agreed on with your partner organization. This may include a short history of the partner organization's pre-existing application or web site, a discussion of the partner organization's motivations in having your team evaluate and improve their system. Essentially, we want to know why this project exists and why it is important.

1. **Project Requirements** (1-2 pages)
A description of the requirements that you agreed on with the partner organization as executed in your project. Leave out any original project requirements that were discarded and add any new requirements that you were not aware of when you turned in P3. 

1. **Accessibility Evaluation** (1-5 pages)
Write up a report summarizing the most important findings from the accessibility evaluation with people with the target disability. This section of your report should include the following sections:
    1. User demographics
    1. Tasks you asked the users to do
    1. Positive aspects of the evaluations (i.e. what about the existing site or application worked well)
    1. Negative aspects of the evaluations (i.e. what kind of challenges did the users experience when trying to use the existing site or application)


1. **Redesign** (1-5 pages)
Your project goal was to design and implement changes to the partner organization's existing application or web site to improve its accessibility. List the user stories that went into the redesign here. 

    1. **User Stories** (2-5 pages)
    List the user stories that helped you document and realize the functional requirements of this project. Include any wireframes, mockups, or storyboards that have influenced the final deliverable. Leave out any original user stories that were discarded and add any new user stories that you developed since turning in P3. 

    1. **Gantt Chart** (1 page)
    Draw a Gantt Chart with all of the implemented user stories arranged by their start and end dates. Annotate each bar in the Gantt Chart with the names of the teammates that worked on the user story represented by the bar. This metadata should be readily accessible from your project management system. 

1. **Evaluation of the Redesign** (1 page)
Write up a report summarizing the most important findings from the accessibility evaluation of the redesign with your classmate. This section of your report should include the following sections:

    1. Negative aspects of the evaluation (i.e. what kind of challenges did the users experience when trying to use the existing site or application)

1. **Redesign Demo** (embedded video)
Embed a YouTube video of a 3-4 minute demo of the redesigned application or web site. Provide a voiceover narration to explain what you are showing the viewer.

1. **Partner Organization Feedback** (1 page)
If you have met with your partner organization and showed them your redesign before P6 is due, write down a summary of their thoughts and opinions about the work. If you only meet with them after P6 is due, add this section to your project report web page prior to Friday, December 13, 11:59pm.
