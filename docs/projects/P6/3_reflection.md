# Project 6C: Project Reflection

## Deliverables

!!! note "Contributions"

    We want to ensure that everyone is participating fully in the final project. For this project, we will be assessing participation in a variety of ways, including: self & peer evaluation as well as assessment by your partner organization. Credit due for the team components of this project will be awarded based on evidence of full participation in the team. **Partial participation will receive partial credit.**

Your individual reflection (20 total points) should include:

1. **Self Evaluation** (8 points)
Describe the work you have done in this project (e.g. design, code, web, or physical artifacts, evaluations, documentation) as well as efforts towards helping your team towards completing this project (e.g. research, organizing meetings, running meetings).

2. **Peer Evaluations** - (6 points)
Describe the specific work **each of your team members** have contributed towards this project. Describe both tangible (e.g. code, web, and physical artifacts, designs, evaluations, report & slides making, documentation) and intangible (e.g. organizing & running meetings, communicating expectations) contributions. Do point out teammates that you think are exceptional to work with in this project as well. 

    You may not duck out of this part of the reflection by simply declaring that all team members contributed equally. You must provide pointers to evidence to back up your understanding of your team members' contributions.

3.	**Teamwork Evaluation** - (6 points)
    You have been in the same team over the course of this semester. Look back on the entire semester and reflect on your team experiences. The following questions may guide you: 
    - What has worked, what hasnâ€™t? 
    - If you could start 05-499/899 or another course over with the same team, what would you change? 
    - What have you learned about teamwork and your role in teamwork?
    - (Optional) Do you have any feedback on what we can do next year to help students work more effectively in teams? Bear in mind that the instructor-assigned heterogeneous teams of 3-5 students is non-negotiable. We anticipate problems as part of the learning experience, but would like to avoid unduly frustrating situations.

A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence such as examples, to support them. 

Submit a PDF of your reflection on **Gradescope** by Monday, December 9, 11:59pm.
